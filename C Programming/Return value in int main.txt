Return value in int main: 

In C programming, the value returned by the main function is used by the operating system to determine the termination status of your program. Returning 0 signifies that the program executed successfully, while returning a non-zero value indicates an error or abnormal termination.

Here's a simple example in C:

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Your code here
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    
    // Returning 0 to indicate successful termination
    return 0;
}



In this example, the main function returns 0, which tells the operating system that the program terminated successfully. If you wanted to indicate an error, you could return a different value, like 1:


#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Your code here
    printf("An error occurred!\n");
    
    // Returning 1 to indicate an error
    return 1;
}
By convention, returning 0 is the standard way to indicate that everything went smoothly.
