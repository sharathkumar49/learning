Great question! C is often referred to as a mid-level programming language because it strikes a balance between low-level and high-level languages. Here's why:

1. Low-Level Features: C allows for manipulation of hardware and memory directly, similar to assembly language. You can use pointers, and access and manipulate memory addresses, which gives you more control over hardware.

2. High-Level Features: At the same time, C offers features of high-level languages such as structured programming, functions, and easy-to-read syntax. This makes it more user-friendly and easier to write and maintain compared to pure assembly language.

Essentially, C provides the power and flexibility of low-level programming languages while also offering the ease of use and abstraction found in high-level languages. This blend makes it uniquely versatile and effective for a wide range of programming tasks!
