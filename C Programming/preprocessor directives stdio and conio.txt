In C programming, #include <stdio.h> and #include <conio.h> are preprocessor directives that include standard library header files. Here's a brief explanation of each:

1. #include <stdio.h>:

Stands for: Standard Input-Output Header.

Purpose: It includes the definitions for the core input and output functions in C, such as printf() for output and scanf() for input.

Usage: This header file is essential for performing standard input and output operations, like reading from the keyboard and writing to the screen.



2. #include <conio.h>:

Stands for: Console Input-Output Header.

Purpose: It includes definitions for functions specifically designed for console input and output, such as getch(), getche(), and clrscr().

Usage: This header is often used in environments like Turbo C/C++ to control console input/output operations directly, such as getting a character input without waiting for the Enter key or clearing the screen.

To summarize:

Use #include <stdio.h> when you need standard input and output functionalities.

Use #include <conio.h> when you need console-specific input and output functionalities, although it's less commonly used in modern programming environments.
