Microsoft Fabric:
-----------------

Microsoft Fabric is an all-in-one analytics solution for enterprises that covers everything from data movement to data science, Real-Time Analytics, and business intelligence. It offers a comprehensive suite of services, including data lake, data engineering, and data integration, all in one place. 

Microsoft Fabric brings together new and existing components from power BI, Azure Synapse, and Azure Data Factory into a single integrated environment. 

The data from different sources(huge data, big data from various sources) --> loaded into Data warehouse as tables--> using these tables, people will create reports using powerBI tool.

when you are reading the data which is from different sources, the data will be huge which is Big Data, okay? the data warehouse tables will not load all the data from the sources as it is. It has to do some filteration like what is needed, what is the subset of the data, what is the meaningful data, only that meaningful data or needed data will get processed from the sources and finally land into the datawarehouse tables. 

On top of these tables generally people will create some reports, for example a report that will show how the revenue is growing. So, the tables will act as a source for generating reports using the powerBI tool.


powerBI --> to generate the reports -->  the people who create the reports are called as data analyst

datawarehouse table --> subset of the big data --> the people who takes the data from different sources and finally putting into the data warehouse are called data Engineers. So, Data Engineers will take the data from different sources and then they will transform it into some meaningful data. Then they will transform the data into Data warehouse Systems.


To do this ETL(Extract, Transform and Load) operations, we need something called Data Factory and for the Data Warehouse needs, we needed something called synapse


So, Microsoft Fabric is SaaS Foundation which has OneLake(which is a big storage and built on the top of gen2) that integrates capabilities like Data Factory, Power BI, Synapse(Data Engineering, Data Science, Data Warehouse, Real-Time Analytics). 

Data Factory -> data integration, the ETL pipeline part, taking the data from different sources, transforming and loading 
Synapse Data Engineering --> apache spark part,
Synapse Data Warehousing --> SQL Table part

Synapse Data Science --> Once you have the data in the data warehouse, not only you can create powerBI reports, you can also create ML models and educate these models, train these models with your buisness data. So, that these models can predict the future


Synapse Real Time Analytics --> This is like Azure Data Explorer, ADX, kusto, if you have any IOT devices or sensors, they will feed huge amounts of the data, is also called generally observational data, so on top of that on real time, if you want to query the data and want to see how the things are working  



In OneLake only, all the data resides, whether your warehouse data or your source data. And as I said, OneLake is built on top of the gen2




Microsoft Fabric:

The Fabric trail requires a PowerBI License. Navigate to 


step 1: create a Outlook account(https://signup.live.com)
step 2: Join Microsoft 365 Developer program




3.

Capacity: Capacity is dedicated set of resources that is available at a given time to be used. Capacity defines the ability of a resource to perform an activity or to produce output.  Fabric offers capacity through the Fabric SKU and Trails. 

Experience: A collection of capabilities targeted to a specific functionality. The Fabric experiences include Synapse Data Warehouse, Synapse Data Engineering, Synapse Data Science, Synapse Real-Time Analytics, Data Factory and PowerBI 

Item: An item is a set of capabilities within an experience. For example, the Data Engineering experience includes lakehouse, notebook and Spark Job which we define as items.

Tenant: A tenant is a single instance of Fabric for an organization and is aligned with Microsoft Entra ID. 

Workspace: A workspace is a collection of items. It acts as a container that leverages capacity for the work that is executed and provides controls for who can access the items in it. For example, in a workspace, user create reports, notebooks, semantic models.




4. How to create a workspace in Microsoft Fabric:

Workspaces are places to collaborate with colleagues to create collections of items such as lakehouses, warehouses and reports.

imagine like one folder, for your entire organization, fabric ID will be there with a tenant ID and inside this fabric, your entire organization may have so many different projects, so that different project people will come there and create their own workspaces and they create a fabric item inside of it


to create a workspace:

select an experience by clicking on Microsoft Fabric in the bottom left of the page (you can select Data Engineering Experince)

Once you selected the experience, the left tab would have many icons, there you can see workspace icon 
Then click workspace and create new workspace 

to check the workspace --> app.fabric.microsoft.com 


5. Roles available in workspace and give access to users in workspace: 

Workspace roles let you manage who can do what in a Microsoft Fabric workspace. 

There are 4 roles in workspaces: 

	1.Admin
	2.Member
	3.Contributor
	4.Viewer
	
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/fundamentals/roles-workspaces


to create a role --> open a workspace --> Manage access --> add people --> then role 






6. what is OneLake?

OneLake is a Single, unified, logical data lake for your whole organization. Like OneDrive, OneLake comes automatically with every Microsoft Fabric tenant and is designed to be the single place for all your analytics data. 

Every Fabric tenant automatically provisions OneLake, with no extra resources to set up or manage. 

Within a workspace, you can create data items and you access all data in OneLake through data items. Similar to how Office store Word, Excel, and Powerpoint files in OneDrive, Fabric store lakehouses, warehouses, and other items in OneLake. 


Learn about Azure Data Lake Storage(Gen2), where oneLake is built on top of this 

All Fabric data items like data warehouses and lakeshouses store their data automatically in OneLake in Delta Parquet format. 

Every workspace appears as a container within the storage account, and different data items appear as folders within those containers. 



if you go check your workspace, you can see the LakeHouse and inside the lakehouse couple of items will be there.  

MySampleLakeHouse
 |
 |
 |-MySampleLakeHouse
       |
	   |-Tables
	     Files
		 
		 
		 
So, in short, 

fabric account is for entire organization
OneLake is a single storage for the entire account

If you create different workspace for the fabric account, for every workspace, a folder will be created and inside the folder, the data items will be there ( it can be data warehouse, data lakehouse





7. OneLake File Explorer to access Fabric data: 
-----------------------------------------------
OneLake is a single, unified, logical data lake for your whole organization. Like OneDrive, OneLake comes automatically with every Microsoft Fabric tenant and is designed to be the single place for all your analytics data. 

The OneLake file explorer application seamlessly integrates OneLake with Windows File Explorer. This application automatically syncs all OneLake items that you have access to in Windows File Explorer.  "Sync" refers to pulling up-to-date metadata on files and folders, and sending changes made locally to the OneLake Service.

8. Bring your data to OneLake with LakeHouse: 
---------------------------------------------
Create a LakeHouse in workspace
Navigate to files and upload it from options
we can check properties of files
Get Data helps to load data using various options such as pipelines, dataflows etc. 


click on the Microsoft Fabric icon --> click on any experience(say Data Engineering) --> click on the workspace or create one --> create a LakeHouse item by clicking on add new button (Now you can bring the data to OneLake via this LakeHouse)  --> Now once you created LakeHouse item, you can see Tables, Files option and using that 'Files' folder you can bring the data inside  the LakeHouse

Also, one more option is, Get data --> this option gives you various different ways to bring the data to the fabric, one way is creating a pipeline. So when you create a pipeline you know that these pipelines are equals to the data Factory pipelines and there is something called copy activity and using that you can bring the data 


So, in-short you can bring the data into the fabric or into the OneLake using the LakeHouse item 




9. What are shortcuts in Fabric?
---------------------------------
Shortcuts are objects in OneLake that point to other storage locations. The location can be internal and external to OneLake. The location that a shortcut points to is known as the target path of the shortcut. 

Shortcuts behave like symbolic links. They're an independent object from the target. If you delete a shortcut, the target remains unaffected. If you move, rename, or delete a target path, the shortcut can break. 

you can create shortcuts in lakehouses and Kusto Query Language(KQL) databases. Furthermore, the shortcuts you create within these items can point to other OneLake locations, Azure DataLake Storage(ADLS) Gen2, Amazon S3 storage accounts, or Dataverse. 


10.to create shortcut in fabric: 

Files --> three dotted icons --> New shortcut --> Microsoft OneLake  --> it will ask for select a data source type --> select the lakehouse 




11. to access shortcuts in spark Notebook: 
-------------------------------------------

Once you created a new item (notebook) --> click Lakehouses --> Add LakeHouse ---> select Existing or New Lakehouse 

Then the lakehouse will be available in the explorer menu, there you can file( say customer.csv) by using Load data option 


you can also 

df = spark.read.format('csv').option('header', 'true').load('Files/customers/customers.csv')

display(df) 


you can also provide the ABFS path (Azure Blob File System)






12. creating ADLS gen2 shortcut in Fabric: 

Say for example in the Azure portal, you have ADLS gen2 storage, and in that you have to mention some container or some files 

So, again in the Files --> New Shortcut --> under the External Sources tab --> you can select Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 





13. Use Python to Manage OneLake in Fabric:  
python to access files and everthing using a python library

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/onelake/onelake-access-python


Open powershell and execute the below command to connect to the Azure account: 

Install-Module -Name Az

Connect-AzAccount 




14. Connect to OneLake using Azure Synapse Analytics




15. what is LakeHouse in Microsoft Fabric

A lakehouse is a unified platform that combines: 
	The flexible and scalable storage of a data lake 
	The ability to query and analyze data of a data warehouse
	
	
Data Lake: 
Scalable, distributed file storage
flexible schema-on-read semantics
Big data technology compatibility


Data Warehouse:
Relational schema modeling 
SQL based querying
proven basis for reporting and analytics
