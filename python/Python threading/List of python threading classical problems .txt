Great question, Sharath â€” sounds like you're building a solid mental map of concurrency challenges. Beyond the Dining Philosophers and Traffic Signal Synchronization, hereâ€™s a curated list of classic and widely discussed threading problems that often come up in systems design, OS theory, and interviews:

ðŸ§  Classic Threading Problems
1. Producer-Consumer Problem  **Done**
   A synchronization issue where producers generate data and consumers use it. The challenge is managing the shared buffer without race conditions or deadlocks.

2. Readers-Writers Problem  
   Multiple threads either read or write to a shared resource. The goal is to allow concurrent reads but exclusive writes, balancing fairness and efficiency.

3. Sleeping Barber Problem  
   Models a barber shop with limited waiting chairs. It explores synchronization between customer and barber threads â€” a metaphor for managing limited resources.

4. Cigarette Smokers Problem  
   A coordination puzzle involving three smokers and an agent. Itâ€™s used to illustrate complex synchronization and resource allocation.

5. Bounded Buffer Problem (a variant of Producer-Consumer)  
   Focuses on a fixed-size buffer, emphasizing blocking behavior when the buffer is full or empty.

6. Barbershop Problem  
   Similar to the sleeping barber but often extended to multiple barbers and customers â€” useful for modeling semaphores and condition variables.

7. Readers-Writers Lock Variants  
   Includes First Readers-Writers Problem (no writer starvation) and Second Readers-Writers Problem (no reader starvation).

8. The Bridge Crossing Problem  
   Models traffic from both directions on a one-lane bridge. Itâ€™s a metaphor for mutual exclusion and fairness.

9. The Train Deadlock Problem  
   Trains on a circular track can deadlock if each occupies a segment and waits for the next. Itâ€™s a visual way to understand circular wait conditions.

10. Banker's Algorithm  
   Not a problem per se, but a classic algorithm to avoid deadlock by simulating resource allocation and ensuring safe states.
