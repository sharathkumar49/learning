Mutable and Immutable Types in Python:
=======================================


In Python, mutable and immutable types refer to whether an objectâ€™s value can be changed after it is created.

Mutable Types:
--------------
Mutable types are objects that can be modified after they are created. This means you can change their contents (e.g., add, remove, or update elements) without changing their identity (i.e., memory address).

Examples of mutable types:

list
dict
set
bytearray

Example:

my_list = [1, 2, 3]
print(id(my_list))  # Memory address before modification

my_list.append(4)  # Modifying the list
print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(id(my_list))  # Memory address remains the same




Immutable Types:
----------------
Immutable types are objects that cannot be modified after they are created. Any change results in a new object being created in memory.

Examples of immutable types:

int
float
bool
str
tuple
frozenset
bytes
Example:

my_string = "hello"
print(id(my_string))  # Memory address before modification

my_string += " world"  # Creating a new string
print(my_string)  # Output: "hello world"
print(id(my_string))  # New memory address



Why does it matter?
Performance Considerations: Immutable types are more efficient in some cases, such as dictionary keys and set elements.
Thread Safety: Immutable objects are safe for concurrent access in multi-threading.
Predictability: Prevents unintended side effects when passing objects between functions.
