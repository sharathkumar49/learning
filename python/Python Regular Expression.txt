Python Regular Expression:
-------------------------
A Regular Expression or RegEx is a special sequence of characters that uses a search pattern to find a string or set of strings.
It can detect the presence or absence of a text by matching it with a particular pattern and also can split a pattern into one or more sub-patterns.


Module: 
-------
import re 



Functions available in re module:
---------------------------------

findall - Returns a list containing all matches
search - Returns a Match object if there is a match anywhere in the string
split - Returns a list where the string has been split at each match
sub - Replaces one or many matches with a string



Why you should python raw strings:

In the context of regular expressions, using Python raw strings is considered a best practice even when you don’t necessarily need them. They absolve you from worrying about the potential conflicts between the regex syntax and Python’s escape character sequences. Raw strings let you think in terms of the regex syntax, regardless of how complicated your regular expression becomes in the future.

More specifically, raw string literals can help you avoid the following problems when you work with regular expressions:

Problem	                Symbol	       Escape Sequence	                             Regular Expression

Conflicting meaning	     \n	           Render a line break	                         Match the non-printable newline character
False friends	         \b	           Move the cursor back one character	         Match a word boundary
Invalid syntax	         \d	           Not applicable	                             Match any digit character



The regular expression syntax shares a few symbols with Python’s escape character sequences. Some symbols refer to the same concept but in a different context, while others remain false friends. Other symbols have a specific meaning within regular expressions but result in an invalid Python string literal.

When you use one of these or a similar symbol in a standard string literal without escaping the backslash character, you may not be able to properly represent the expected regular expression:

>>> import re
>>> text = "Pythonic means idiomatic in Python."
>>> re.findall("Python\b", text)
[]



In this code example, the string literal "Python\b" contains the word 'Python' followed by the non-printable backspace character(\b), which isn’t present in the text to search through. As a result, re.findall() returns an empty list.

On the other hand, when you escape this special character sequence (\\b), it becomes the literal part of the string. The regular expression that it represents can now match the word boundary at the end of the sentence:

>>> re.findall("Python\\b", text)
['Python']


Unfortunately, escaping becomes particularly prone to the leaning toothpick syndrome mentioned earlier when combined with regular expressions. Therefore, you’re better off using Python’s raw string literals in the first place:

>>> re.findall(r"Python\b", text)
['Python']


This code works as expected, and your string literal looks much cleaner. Although this example may not show a spectacular improvement, using raw strings becomes more important as your regular expressions get more complicated.

Note: Remember that raw strings can only help with string literals defined in Python source code. If you load your regular expression from a file or elsewhere, then you don’t need to take any extra steps because the resulting string object will already be in the right format.

At this point, you have a pretty good idea about the benefits that raw string literals bring to Python. However, that isn’t to say they’re without their own set of challenges. In the next section, you’ll learn when to be careful about using them.

'r' in the pattern: 


In Python, the prefix 'r' before a string denotes a raw string literal. It ensures that backslashes (\) inside the string are treated literally, rather than as escape sequences.

Why Use 'r' in Regular Expressions?
Regular expressions often contain backslash-escaped sequences like \d (digits), \s (whitespace), or \w (word characters). If we don't use a raw string, Python interprets the backslashes before passing the pattern to the regex engine.

Example Without Raw String (Incorrect Behavior):
import re

pattern = "\d\d\d"  # Python interprets `\d` as an escape sequence
print(pattern)  # Output: 'dd' (Unexpected behavior)

match = re.search(pattern, "123")
print(match)  # None (Failed match)



Example With Raw String (Correct Behavior):
python
import re

pattern = r"\d\d\d"  # Raw string ensures `\d` is correctly passed to regex
match = re.search(pattern, "123")
print(match.group())  # Output: '123'


Can We Have It or Not?
Yes, using 'r' before regex patterns is optional, but highly recommended. Without it, Python's string escaping can lead to unexpected behavior when backslashes are involved.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I don't understand clearly, involving backslass '\' without the rawstring, the python interpreter thinks it as some escape sequence. where with raw string, it thinks it is regular expression special sequence word. Is that what you're saying. Explain me clearly



Yes, you're on the right track! Let me clarify it in a structured way:

1. How Python Treats Backslashes (\):
In Python, the backslash (\) has a special meaning inside normal strings:
It acts as an escape character for things like \n (newline), \t (tab), or \" (quotes).
If you write "\d", Python tries to interpret \d as an escape sequence, but \d is not a predefined escape in Python, so it can cause unintended behavior.

Example (Normal String Behavior):
print("\nHello")  # Output starts on a new line because `\n` means "newline"
print("\tHello")  # Output has a tab space before "Hello"
print("\d\d\d")   # Output: 'dd' (Unexpected! Python treats `\d` as an invalid escape)



2. Using a Raw String (r"...")
When you prefix a string with 'r', like r"\d\d\d", Python treats backslashes literally.
It does NOT interpret them as escape sequences.
This is extremely useful in regular expressions, where backslashes are common (\d, \w, s etc.).

Example (Raw String Fixes the Issue):
import re

pattern = r"\d\d\d"  # Raw string ensures \d remains \d for regex processing
match = re.search(pattern, "123")
print(match.group())  # Output: '123' (Correct behavior)



Key Takeaway:
Without raw strings ("\d") → Python misinterprets \d and may treat it incorrectly.
With raw strings (r"\d") → Python preserves the backslash, ensuring it is correctly passed to the regex engine.
