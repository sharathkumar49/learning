How does Python implement metaprogramming using class decorators?

In Python, metaprogramming using class decorators involves modifying or enhancing the behavior of classes by wrapping them with another class or function. Class decorators are functions that take a class as input and return a new class, typically with some modifications.

Here's a simple example to demonstrate how class decorators work:


def add_method(cls):
    def new_method(self, x, y):
        return x + y
    cls.add = new_method
    return cls

@add_method
class MyClass:
    pass

obj = MyClass()
print(obj.add(2, 3))  # Output: 5


In this example, add_method is a class decorator that adds a new method called 'add' to the class it decorates. When the MyClass class is defined with @add_method, it is effectively transformed into a new class with the add method added.

Behind the scenes, the @add_method syntax is equivalent to calling MyClass = add_method(MyClass). The add_method function takes the MyClass as input, adds the add method to it, and returns the modified class.

Class decorators are powerful tools for metaprogramming in Python, allowing you to dynamically modify classes at runtime to add functionality, enforce constraints, or implement other custom behavior.
