You're diving into some of the most crucial aspects of database design and optimization! Let's break down each topic comprehensively.

Schema Design:
A well-structured schema is essential for database performance and maintainability. 

Two key approaches are normalization and denormalization:

Normalization is the process of organizing data to minimize redundancy and dependency by splitting it into smaller, related tables. The goals include:
  - Reducing data duplication
  - Improving consistency and integrity
  - Making updates more efficient
  - Common forms: 1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF, 4NF, and 5NF
  
Denormalization is the process of combining tables to reduce the need for complex joins, improving read performance at the cost of increased storage and potential inconsistencies.

When choosing between the two, consider:
- OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) systems favor normalization to ensure data integrity.
- OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) systems favor denormalization to optimize read-heavy queries.

Composite Primary Keys
A composite primary key consists of multiple columns used together to uniquely identify a record. These are often needed in junction tables (for many-to-many relationships). While they help enforce uniqueness, they can complicate indexing and query performance.



Indexing Strategies
Indexes speed up lookups but may slow down inserts/updates. Some common strategies:
- Clustered Index: Stores data in order based on the index; one per table.
- Non-clustered Index: Maintains a separate structure to improve lookup speed.
- Covering Index: Includes all the columns required by a query, eliminating the need to access the main table.
- Partial Indexes: Indexes a subset of rows based on conditions to optimize specific queries.
- Composite Index: Indexes multiple columns together for queries that filter by multiple criteria.







Query Optimization
Efficient queries ensure minimal computation and fast response times. Key techniques:

Efficient Joins
- Prefer INNER JOIN for filtering unnecessary rows early.
- Ensure indexed columns are used in join conditions.
- Reduce nested subqueries and prefer common table expressions (CTEs) or joins.

Partitioning
Partitioning divides tables into smaller, more manageable pieces, improving query performance.
- Horizontal Partitioning: Divides rows based on a range (e.g., date-based partitions).
- Vertical Partitioning: Splits columns across different tables.
- Composite Partitioning: A mix of both.

Query Caching
Caching stores results of expensive queries to improve response times.
- Application-level caching (Memcached, Redis)
- Materialized views to store precomputed query results

Consistency Models
Consistency determines how updates are propagated across distributed databases.

ACID Properties (Ensuring strong consistency)
- Atomicity: Transactions are all-or-nothing.
- Consistency: The database remains valid after transactions.
- Isolation: Transactions don't interfere with each other.
- Durability: Committed changes persist even after failures.

BASE Model (Eventually consistent approach for scalability)
- Basically Available: System guarantees availability.
- Soft state: The system may have temporary inconsistency.
- Eventual consistency: The database eventually reaches a consistent state.





Sharding & Replication:
Sharding (Database Partitioning)
Sharding distributes data across multiple nodes to scale performance.
- Key-based sharding: Uses a hash or a key to determine shard placement.
- Range-based sharding: Divides data based on value ranges (e.g., date).
- Geographical sharding: Data is distributed based on regional usage.

Replication (Leader-Follower Model)
Replication creates multiple copies of the database to improve availability and performance.
- Leader-Follower Replication: Writes go to the leader, reads are distributed among followers.
- Multi-Leader Replication: Multiple nodes accept writes, improving availability.
- Quorum-based Replication: Ensures consistency in distributed systems.



Conclusion:
Each technique has trade-offs and should be tailored to the system's requirements—whether optimizing read vs. write performance, ensuring data consistency, or scaling across distributed environments.

What are common mistakes to avoid in database optimization?


Optimizing a database can significantly improve performance, but there are several pitfalls to watch out for. Here are some common mistakes to avoid:

Schema Design Mistakes
1. Over-Normalization – Excessive normalization can lead to complex joins and degraded performance. Balance normalization with practical use cases.
2. Denormalization Without Justification – While denormalization speeds up reads, it increases data redundancy and inconsistency risks.
3. Ignoring Data Types – Using inappropriate data types (e.g., VARCHAR instead of INT for numerical IDs) leads to unnecessary storage overhead and slower queries.
4. Not Planning for Growth – Designing schemas without considering scalability can result in costly migrations later.

Indexing Pitfalls
5. Too Many Indexes – Over-indexing slows down INSERT and UPDATE operations due to frequent index maintenance.
6. No Indexing on Foreign Keys – Queries that join tables on foreign keys can be inefficient if indexes aren't applied.
7. Ignoring Composite Indexes – Failing to create indexes that match query patterns (e.g., filtering on multiple columns) leads to unnecessary full table scans.

Query Performance Issues
8. Using SELECT * – Retrieving all columns instead of only required fields increases I/O load.
9. Neglecting Query Execution Plans – Failing to analyze execution plans leads to overlooked optimization opportunities.
10. Subquery Overuse – Nested subqueries often perform worse than joins or common table expressions (CTEs).
11. Inefficient Joins – Not using indexed join conditions or unnecessary cross joins slows down queries.
12. Ignoring Partitioning – Large datasets benefit from partitioning strategies (e.g., range, hash).

Transaction & Consistency Mistakes
13. Holding Transactions Too Long – Long-running transactions lock resources and impact concurrency.
14. Ignoring ACID Compliance – Choosing eventual consistency where strict transactional integrity is needed can cause data anomalies.
15. Overusing Auto-Commit – Frequent auto-commits on large operations cause unnecessary I/O overhead.

Sharding & Replication Issues
16. Incorrect Shard Key Selection – Poor shard keys can lead to unbalanced partitions and bottlenecks.
17. Replicating Unnecessary Data – Copying everything across replicas increases storage and synchronization overhead.

Maintenance & Monitoring Oversights
18. Not Regularly Analyzing Performance Metrics – Without monitoring, inefficiencies go unnoticed.
19. Neglecting Database Cleanup – Unused indexes, fragmented tables, and redundant data slow performance.
20. Skipping Backups – Failing to maintain backups can result in catastrophic data loss.
