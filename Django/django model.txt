Django Models form the architectural foundation for database-driven applications. A model serves as a data structure and includes essential fields and behaviors.


Model Definition:
A model class is a Python subclass of django.db.models.Model. Each attribute within the class represents a database field.
The model class specifies the database table name, any data relationships, metadata, and methods for data manipulation.


Key Model Components:
Fields
	Definition: Represent the table's columns.
	Types: e.g., CharField, DateField.
	Primary Key: id is default or can be customized.
	Descriptors: Define field attributes e.g., null, blank.
Meta Options
	table_name: Database table name.
	unique_together: A list of tuples for fields that should be unique when considered together.
	ordering: Default result order.
Methods
	Objects: Custom data managers.
	__str__(): Human-readable instance name for admin and more.
	
	
Example: Model Code
Here is the Django code for the Author and Book model which demonstrates relationships between the two models:

from django.db import models

class Author(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    birth_date = models.DateField()

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name

class Book(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    author = models.ForeignKey(Author, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    published_date = models.DateField()
    genres = models.ManyToManyField('Genre')

    def __str__(self):
        return self.title

class Genre(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name


In this example:
Author and Book are model classes, each with its own table and fields in the database.
Author has a ManyToMany relationship with Genre through the Book model.
ForeignKey, linking Book to Author, establishes a one-to-many relationship.
The ForeignKey indicates each Book relates to one Author, while the cascade on_delete specifies that if an Author is deleted, all their books are also deleted.
