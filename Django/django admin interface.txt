Describe the purpose of Django's admin interface.
The Django admin interface is a powerful tool that automatically generates a user-friendly interface for performing common data management tasks, such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD operations) for your application's models.


Key Features:
-------------
Quick Implementation: Provides out-of-the-box tools for data management, requiring minimal setup.
Model-Centric Interface: Operations are organized based on your application's data models.
DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) Philosophy: Changes to your models are automatically reflected in the admin interface.


Common Admin Actions:
---------------------
Database Records: View, add, edit, and delete records.
Data Relationships: Navigate through foreign key and many-to-many relationships.
Data Validation: Basic field-level validation is performed.


When to Use and When Not to Use the Admin Interface:
----------------------------------------------------
When to Use:
Rapid Prototyping: For quick feedback or proof of concept.
Administrative Tasks: For internal tools or during early project stages.
Quick Data Fixes: Ad-hoc data corrections or debugging.


Code Example: Setting Up the Admin Interface
Here is the Python code:

from django.contrib import admin
from .models import MyModel

@admin.register(MyModel)
class MyModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_display = ('field1', 'field2', 'some_method', 'related_field__nested_field')
    list_filter = ('field1', 'field2')
    search_fields = ('field1', 'field2', 'related_field__nested_field__name')

    def some_method(self, obj):
        return obj.field1 + " - " + obj.field2
    some_method.short_description = 'Custom Description'


When Not to Use:
Production Client-Facing UI: The admin interface is not designed for public, customer-facing views. It's preferable to create custom views using Django's forms and templating for public consumption.
Complex Data Operations: For intricate data management or workflows, a custom UI provides better control and user experience.




Admin Interface in urls.py
--------------------------
Here is the Python code:

from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    # ...
]
