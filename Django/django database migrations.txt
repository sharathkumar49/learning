What is a database migration in Django and why is it important?
Database migrations in Django are changes to the database schema, ensuring it stays in sync with the evolving data models. Each migration is represented as a Python file, making alterations via the django.db.migrations module.

Key Components:
Migration Files: These are generated sequentially and outline the changes to be applied to the database.
Migrations Modules: A collection of related migration files.
Migration Plan: A record of applied and unapplied migrations.

Why Use Migrations?
Version Control: Migrations are text-based, making them ideal for version control systems like Git.
Data Integrity: They help ensure that data remains consistent as the schema evolves.
Collaboration: Simplifies team collaboration and deployment processes.
Adaptability: Migrations can be tailored for different databases, such as PostgreSQL or MySQL.


Basic Migration Commands:
1. Initial Migration: Generate the initial database schema from models.
python manage.py makemigrations

2. Apply Migrations: Execute the pending migrations on the database.
python manage.py migrate

3. Migrations Plan: Check the status of migrations.
python manage.py showmigrations

Advanced developers may often require more intricate migration commands and functionalities. Fortuitously, Django offers a versatile array of options to accommodate those needs.
