Explain the difference between a ForeignKey and a ManyToManyField in Django models
In Django models, relationships can be established using either a ForeignKey or a ManyToManyField, each serving a unique purpose.

ForeignKey:
-----------
A ForeignKey sets up a many-to-one relationship. It's used when each record in the current model needs to be associated with exactly one record in another model.

Example:
A Book has one Publisher.
This is represented by a ForeignKey in the Book model pointing to the Publisher model.

Code Example (ForeignKey):
from django.db import models

class Publisher(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

class Book(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    publisher = models.ForeignKey(Publisher, on_delete=models.CASCADE)




ManyToManyField:
----------------
A ManyToManyField is used when a record in one model can be associated with multiple records in another, and vice versa.

Many-to-Many Relationship:
It facilitates a many-to-many relationship where multiple records in one model can be linked to multiple records in another.

Example:
A Student can enroll in multiple Courses, and a Course can have multiple students enrolled.
This many-to-many relationship is represented using a ManyToManyField with an intermediary table.

Code Example (ManyToManyField):
from django.db import models

class Course(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

class Student(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    courses = models.ManyToManyField(Course)
	
	
	
ManyToManyField with Additional Fields (through):
-------------------------------------------------
Sometimes, the relationship between the two models needs to have additional fields. ManyToManyField allows you to specify a custom intermediary model using the through parameter.

Here is an example:
You have a Music Library and want to associate Songs with Playlists, but you also want to track the order of the songs in each playlist.

You would use a model like PlaylistSong as the intermediary model.

class Playlist(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

class Song(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    playlists = models.ManyToManyField(Playlist, through='PlaylistSong')
    
class PlaylistSong(models.Model):
    song = models.ForeignKey(Song, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    playlist = models.ForeignKey(Playlist, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    order = models.IntegerField()
    # Possibly other fields like 'added_by' and 'date_added'
	
	
Here, the PlaylistSong model contains the additional order field to track the song's order in the playlist.



(need to check that sometime manytomany relationship has an attribute from code with mosh)
