Django project vs app:
----------------------

What is a Django project and how is it different from a Django app?
Django Project is the high-level umbrella under which you build a web application. It encompasses multiple components such as settings, URLs, and can host several apps.

In contrast, a Django App is a standalone module designed to serve a specific functionality or business area, following the concept of "application" as a group of related features.

Key Components of a Django Project:
-----------------------------------  
Settings: Configuration options for the project and its apps.
URLs: Defines the endpoint mappings using urls.py.
WSGI/ASGI: Entry points for the web server to serve the project, handling HTTP and WebSocket requests, respectively.

Key Components of a Django App
Models: Data layer, defining data structures using models.py.
Views: Business logic and request-response handler.
Templates (optional): Presentation layer, housing HTML and rendering logic.
URLs: Endpoint mappings for the app, known as "scoped URLs".


Code Example: Project and App Structure
Here is the folder structure.

myproject/     # Django Project
    manage.py  # Project Management Utility
    myproject/ # Project Directory
        settings.py
        urls.py
        wsgi.py
        asgi.py
    myapp1/    # Django App 1
    myapp2/    # Django App 2
    ...
	
	
It shows the typical structure where a project contains one or more apps.

Django Project and App Overview
-------------------------------
In Django, a project is the overarching container for your web application, while an app is a modular component within the project that performs a specific function or feature. A project can contain multiple apps, and apps can be reused across different projects.


Django Project Structure:
-------------------------
When you create a Django project using the django-admin startproject command, it generates a directory structure like this:


myproject/
    manage.py
    myproject/
        __init__.py
        settings.py
        urls.py
        asgi.py
        wsgi.py


Key Components of a Project
---------------------------
1. manage.py:
   - A command-line utility to interact with the project.
   - Used for tasks like running the development server, applying migrations, and creating apps.

2. settings.py:
   - The main configuration file for the project.
   - Contains settings like database configuration, installed apps, middleware, templates, and more.

3. urls.py:
   - The URL configuration file for the project.
   - Maps URLs to views using Django's URL dispatcher.

4. asgi.py and wsgi.py:
   - Entry points for ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) and WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) servers.
   - Used to deploy the project.

5. __init__.py:
   - Marks the directory as a Python package.



Django App Structure:
---------------------
When you create an app using the python manage.py startapp command, it generates a directory structure like this:


myapp/
    __init__.py
    admin.py
    apps.py
    migrations/
        __init__.py
    models.py
    tests.py
    views.py


Key Components of an App:
------------------------
1. __init__.py:
   - Marks the directory as a Python package.

2. admin.py:
   - Used to register models with the Django admin interface.

3. apps.py:
   - Contains the app configuration class (e.g., CoreConfig in your example).
   - Used to define app-specific settings and initialization code.

4. migrations/:
   - Contains migration files for database schema changes.
   - Each migration file represents a change to the database schema.

5. models.py:
   - Defines the data models (database tables) for the app.

6. tests.py:
   - Contains unit tests for the app.

7. views.py:
   - Contains the logic for handling HTTP requests and returning responses.



How Projects and Apps Work Together:
- A project is a collection of settings and configurations that tie together multiple apps.
- An app is a modular component that provides specific functionality (e.g., user authentication, blog, e-commerce).
- Apps are added to the INSTALLED_APPS list in the project's settings.py to make them part of the project.



Brief About Components in Your Example
In your apps.py file, the CoreConfig class is defined for the core app. Here's how it fits into the project:

1. default_auto_field:
   - Specifies the default primary key type for models in the app.

2. name:
   - Specifies the full Python path to the app (core).

3. ready():
   - This method is used to run initialization code when the app is loaded.
   - In your case, it imports core.signals.handlers, which likely contains signal handlers for the app.



 Summary
- A Django project is the overall container for your web application, while an app is a modular component that provides specific functionality.
- The project structure includes files like settings.py, urls.py, and manage.py, while the app structure includes files like models.py, views.py, and apps.py.
- The apps.py file in your example is used to configure the core app and initialize signal handlers when the app is loaded.
