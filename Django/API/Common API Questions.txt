Common API Questions:
What is an API, and how does it work?
What are REST APIs, and how are they different from SOAP APIs?
What are HTTP methods in REST APIs? (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
What are status codes in API responses? (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error)
How do authentication and authorization work in APIs? (OAuth, JWT, API keys)
What are rate limits in APIs, and why are they important?
What is versioning in APIs, and how is it implemented?
How do you design a scalable and secure REST API?
What are best practices for error handling in APIs?
How does caching improve API performance?


Real-Life API Problems & How to Handle Them:
Slow API Response Times
Solution: Implement caching, optimize database queries, and use pagination for large datasets.

Authentication Issues
Solution: Use secure authentication mechanisms like OAuth, JWT, and regularly update API keys.

Handling High Traffic Loads
Solution: Employ rate limiting, load balancing, and scalable architecture (cloud-based solutions).

Data Format Mismatch Between Clients & APIs
Solution: Standardize data formats (JSON/XML) and document API specifications properly.

Security Vulnerabilities (SQL Injection, Unauthorized Access, etc.)
Solution: Use input validation, apply HTTPS, enforce authorization rules, and audit API security.

Breaking API Changes
Solution: Implement versioning (e.g., /v1/users vs. /v2/users) and ensure backward compatibility.

Limited API Documentation
Solution: Use tools like Swagger/OpenAPI to provide well-structured and accessible API documentation.

**Real-Life API Problems & Solutions (Expanded):**
- Inconsistent API responses  
  Solution: Enforce strict response schemas and use automated contract testing.
- API downtime or outages  
  Solution: Implement redundancy, health checks, and graceful degradation.
- Data privacy concerns  
  Solution: Mask sensitive data, use encryption, and comply with data protection regulations.
- API abuse or misuse  
  Solution: Monitor usage, apply rate limiting, and block suspicious activity.
- Lack of observability and monitoring  
  Solution: Integrate logging, tracing, and monitoring tools.
- Difficulty in onboarding new API consumers  
  Solution: Provide clear documentation, SDKs, and sample code.
- Handling backward-incompatible changes  
  Solution: Use versioning, deprecation notices, and migration guides.
