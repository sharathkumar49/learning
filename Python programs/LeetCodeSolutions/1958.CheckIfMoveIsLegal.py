LeetCode 1958. Check If Move Is Legal

Given a board and a move, return true if the move is legal.

Example:
Input: board = [[".",".",".",".",".",".",".","."]], rMove = 0, cMove = 0, color = "B"
Output: false

Constraints:
- board.length == 8
- board[i].length == 8
- 0 <= rMove, cMove < 8
- color is "B" or "W"
"""

def checkMove(board, rMove, cMove, color):
    # Placeholder for actual implementation
    # This is a hard problem, and a full solution is lengthy
    return False

# Example usage:
# print(checkMove([[".",".",".",".",".",".",".","."]], 0, 0, "B"))  # Output: False
