LeetCode 2307. Checking Existence of Edge Length Limited Paths

Given n, edgeList, and queries, return true/false for each query if a path exists with all edges less than limit.

Example:
Input: n = 3, edgeList = [[0,1,2],[1,2,4],[2,0,8]], queries = [[0,1,2],[1,2,6]]
Output: [false,true]

Constraints:
- 2 <= n <= 10^5
- 1 <= edgeList.length, queries.length <= 10^5
"""

def distanceLimitedPathsExist(n, edgeList, queries):
    # Placeholder for union-find solution
    return [False]*len(queries)

# Example usage:
# print(distanceLimitedPathsExist(3, [[0,1,2],[1,2,4],[2,0,8]], [[0,1,2],[1,2,6]]))  # Output: [False,True]
