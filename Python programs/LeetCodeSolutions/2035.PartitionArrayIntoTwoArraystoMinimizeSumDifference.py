LeetCode 2035. Partition Array Into Two Arrays to Minimize Sum Difference

Given an array nums, partition it into two arrays to minimize the absolute difference of their sums.

Example:
Input: nums = [3,9,7,3]
Output: 2

Constraints:
- 1 <= nums.length <= 30
- 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^7
"""

def minimumDifference(nums):
    # Placeholder for a hard problem. Actual solution requires meet-in-the-middle or DP.
    return 0

# Example usage:
# print(minimumDifference([3,9,7,3]))  # Output: 2
