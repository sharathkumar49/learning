235. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree
https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-search-tree/

Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.
The LCA of two nodes p and q is the lowest node in BST that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).

Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 10^5].
- -10^9 <= Node.val <= 10^9
- All Node.val are unique.
- p != q
- p and q will exist in the BST.

Example 1:
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
Output: 6

Example 2:
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
Output: 2

    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):

        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def lowestCommonAncestor(root, p, q):
    while root:
        if p.val < root.val and q.val < root.val:
            root = root.left

            root = root.right
        else:
            return root

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    root = TreeNode(6, TreeNode(2, TreeNode(0), TreeNode(4, TreeNode(3), TreeNode(5))), TreeNode(8, TreeNode(7), TreeNode(9)))
    p = root.left

    print(lowestCommonAncestor(root, p, q).val)  # Output: 6
    p2 = root.left
    q2 = root.left.right
    print(lowestCommonAncestor(root, p2, q2).val)  # Output: 2
