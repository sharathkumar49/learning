LeetCode 1778. Shortest Path in a Hidden Grid

This is an interactive problem. You are given a grid with hidden cells and can only move to adjacent cells if they are open. Return the shortest path from the start to the target.

Example 1:
Input: grid = [[1,0,0],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]
Output: 4

Constraints:
- 1 <= grid.length, grid[0].length <= 100
- grid[i][j] is 0 or 1
