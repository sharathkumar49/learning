LeetCode 1932. Merge BSTs to Create Single BST

Given a list of BSTs, merge them into a single BST if possible.

Example:
Input: trees = [[2,1],[3,2,5],[5,4]]
Output: [3,2,5,1,null,4]

Constraints:
- 1 <= trees.length <= 5000
- 1 <= trees[i].length <= 3
- 1 <= trees[i][j] <= 10^5
"""

def canMerge(trees):
    # Placeholder for actual implementation
    # This is a hard problem, and a full solution is lengthy
    return None

# Example usage:
# print(canMerge([[2,1],[3,2,5],[5,4]]))
