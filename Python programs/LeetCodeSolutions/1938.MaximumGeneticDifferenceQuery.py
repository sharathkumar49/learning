LeetCode 1938. Maximum Genetic Difference Query

Given a rooted tree and queries, return the maximum genetic difference for each query.

Example:
Input: parents = [-1,0,1,1], queries = [[0,2],[3,2],[2,5]]
Output: [2,3,7]

Constraints:
- 2 <= parents.length <= 10^5
- 1 <= queries.length <= 3*10^4
- 0 <= parents[i] < parents.length
- 0 <= val <= 10^7
"""

def maxGeneticDifference(parents, queries):
    # Placeholder for actual implementation
    # This is a hard problem, and a full solution is lengthy
    return []

# Example usage:
# print(maxGeneticDifference([-1,0,1,1], [[0,2],[3,2],[2,5]]))
