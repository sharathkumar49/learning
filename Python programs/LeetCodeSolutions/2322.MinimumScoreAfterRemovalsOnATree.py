LeetCode 2322. Minimum Score After Removals on a Tree

Given n, edges, and nums, return the minimum score after removals.

Example:
Input: n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[1,3],[3,4],[3,5],[5,6]], nums = [1,5,5,4,11,6,1]
Output: 9

Constraints:
- 2 <= n <= 10^5
"""

def minimumScore(n, edges, nums):
    # Placeholder for DFS solution
    return 0

# Example usage:
# print(minimumScore(7, [[0,1],[1,2],[1,3],[3,4],[3,5],[5,6]], [1,5,5,4,11,6,1]))  # Output: 9
