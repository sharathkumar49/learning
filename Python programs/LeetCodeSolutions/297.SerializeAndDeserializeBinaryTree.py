297. Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree

Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

Clarification: The input/output format is the same as how LeetCode serializes a binary tree. You do not need to implement these methods.

Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10^4].
- -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000

# Example usage:
# codec = Codec()
# tree = codec.deserialize('1,2,#,#,3,4,#,#,5,#,#')
# print(codec.serialize(tree))  # Output: '1,2,#,#,3,4,#,#,5,#,#'
