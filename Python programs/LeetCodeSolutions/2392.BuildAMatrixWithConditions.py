LeetCode 2392. Build a Matrix With Conditions

Given row and column conditions, build a matrix that satisfies them.

Constraints:
- 1 <= k <= 10^3
- 1 <= rowConditions.length, colConditions.length <= k
"""

def buildMatrix(k, rowConditions, colConditions):
    # Placeholder for topological sort solution
    pass

# Example usage:
# print(buildMatrix(3, [[1,2],[2,3]], [[2,1],[3,2]]))  # Output: (example)
