197. Rising Temperature
https://leetcode.com/problems/rising-temperature/

Write an SQL query to find all dates' Id with higher temperatures compared to its previous dates (yesterday).

Table: Weather
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| recordDate    | date    |
| temperature   | int     |
+---------------+---------+
id is the primary key for this table.

Example:
Weather table:
+----+------------+-------------+
| id | recordDate | temperature |
+----+------------+-------------+
| 1  | 2015-01-01 | 10          |
| 2  | 2015-01-02 | 25          |
| 3  | 2015-01-03 | 20          |
| 4  | 2015-01-04 | 30          |
+----+------------+-------------+

Result table:
+----+
| id |
+----+
| 2  |
| 4  |
+----+

Solution:
SELECT w1.id
FROM Weather w1, Weather w2
WHERE DATEDIFF(w1.recordDate, w2.recordDate) = 1 AND w1.temperature > w2.temperature;
