LeetCode 2030. Smallest K-Length Subsequence With Occurrences of a Letter

Given a string s, an integer k, and a character letter, return the lexicographically smallest subsequence of length k with the maximum number of occurrences of letter.

Example:
Input: s = "leet", k = 3, letter = "e"
Output: "eet"

Constraints:
- 1 <= k <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4
- s consists of lowercase English letters
- letter is a lowercase English letter

def smallestSubsequence(s, k, letter):
    # Placeholder for a hard problem. Actual solution requires greedy and stack.
    return ""

# Example usage:
# print(smallestSubsequence("leet", 3, "e"))  # Output: "eet"
