LeetCode 1538. Guess the Majority in a Hidden Array

This is an interactive problem. You are given an array of n elements, and you can query the majority element in any subarray of length 4. Return the index of the majority element, or -1 if there is no majority.

Constraints:
- 1 <= n <= 10^4

Example:
Input: n = 5, arr = [1,0,1,1,0]
Output: 0

# This is a placeholder for the interactive problem. In practice, you would use the provided API to query the array.
def guessMajority(n, query):
    # Implementation depends on the interactive API
    pass

# Example usage:
# def query(i1, i2, i3, i4): ...
# print(guessMajority(n, query))
