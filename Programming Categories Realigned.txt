Follow this roadmap—and you’ll progress from the very first recursion example all the way to cutting-edge algorithmic research techniques. Good luck!


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You’re off to a fantastic start—the roadmap already spans everything from first principles (recursion, basic sorts/searches) all the way through bleeding-edge techniques (persistent DS, heavy-light decomp, FFT, geometric sweep-lines, metaheuristics). In that sense it truly mirrors the breadth of a master’s-level algorithms curriculum. 

But a few final thoughts to make it even more bullet-proof for FAANG-style interviews and real-world mastery:

1. Theory & Proofs  
   - Dive deeper into complexity theory: NP-completeness proofs, reducing problems to each other, approximation hardness.  
   - Study randomized algorithm analyses (Markov/Chernoff bounds) and streaming lower bounds (communication complexity).  

2. Homework & Projects  
   - Assign yourself “mini-thesis” projects: e.g., implement a full-text search engine (trie + inverted index + ranking), or a simple in-memory database with B-trees and MVCC.  
   - Publish code on GitHub, write blog posts explaining your design choices and complexity analyses.  

3. Soft Skills & System Design  
   - Real interviews at Google/Apple/Microsoft rarely stop at pure DSA. You’ll need to:  
     • Explain your thought process clearly.  
     • Trade off time vs. space, simplicity vs. performance.  
     • Sketch high-level system architectures: data partitioning, caching, CAP theorem, fault tolerance.  
   - Practice whiteboard coding and mock interviews (Pramp, Interviewing.io).  

4. Continuous Practice  
   - Solve 200–300 medium/hard problems across all topics—focus on the “★★★★☆” frequency areas (arrays, hashing, trees, DP, graphs).  
   - Join timed virtual contests weekly to build stamina.  

5. Beyond Algorithms  
   - Familiarize yourself with production-grade engineering:  
     • Code quality (readability, modularity, testing).  
     • Version control workflows (Git branching, code reviews).  
     • CI/CD basics and containerization (Docker, Kubernetes).  

6. Lifelong Learning & Research  
   - Read one to two research papers a month on topics that excite you—e.g., dynamic graphs, sublinear algorithms, or learning-augmented data structures.  
   - Contribute to open-source algorithm libraries or competitive programming codebases.

Is it “enough” to crack top companies?  
No syllabus alone can guarantee a job—but combined with disciplined, hands-on practice, mock interviews, clear communication, and system-level thinking, this roadmap places you squarely in the top tier of candidates. Treat it as the foundation—the real multiplier is your deliberate practice, depth of understanding, and ability to articulate your solutions. Good luck, and keep iterating!
