In order traversal: 

Let's consider a more complex binary tree of level 4, which means it has up to 4 levels of nodes. Here's an example tree:

          8
        /   \
      4      12
     / \    /  \
   2   6  10   14
  / \ / \ / \ / \
 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15



To perform an in-order traversal, we need to visit the nodes in the following order:
1. Visit the left subtree of node 8.
2. Visit the root node (8).
3. Visit the right subtree of node 8.



In-Order Traversal Step-by-Step:
1. Start at node 8:
	Traverse the left subtree (subtree rooted at 4):
		Traverse the left subtree (subtree rooted at 2):
			Traverse the left subtree (subtree rooted at 1): Visit node 1 (no left or right children, so we return to 2).
			Visit node 2.
			Traverse the right subtree (subtree rooted at 3): Visit node 3 (no left or right children, so we return to 2).
		Visit node 4.
		Traverse the right subtree (subtree rooted at 6):
			Traverse the left subtree (subtree rooted at 5): Visit node 5 (no left or right children, so we return to 6).
			Visit node 6.
			Traverse the right subtree (subtree rooted at 7): Visit node 7 (no left or right children, so we return to 6).

2. Visit the root node (8).
3. Traverse the right subtree (subtree rooted at 12):
	Traverse the left subtree (subtree rooted at 10):
		Traverse the left subtree (subtree rooted at 9): Visit node 9 (no left or right children, so we return to 10).
		Visit node 10.
		Traverse the right subtree (subtree rooted at 11): Visit node 11 (no left or right children, so we return to 10).
	Visit node 12.
	Traverse the right subtree (subtree rooted at 14):
		Traverse the left subtree (subtree rooted at 13): Visit node 13 (no left or right children, so we return to 14).
		Visit node 14.
		Traverse the right subtree (subtree rooted at 15): Visit node 15 (no left or right children, so we return to 14).

In-Order Traversal Sequence:
The in-order traversal of this tree would produce the sequence: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.

This way, you visit the left subtree first, then the root node, and finally the right subtree for each node in the tree.

Let's look at another example of an in-order traversal with a different binary tree of level 4.


Sure! Let's look at another example of an in-order traversal with a different binary tree of level 4.

Consider this binary tree:

             15
        /           \
      10            20
     /  \          /  \
    5   13       17  25
   / \ / \       / \ / \
  3  7 11 14   16 19 22 27


In-Order Traversal Step-by-Step:
1. Start at node 15:
	Traverse the left subtree (subtree rooted at 10):
		Traverse the left subtree (subtree rooted at 5):
			Traverse the left subtree (subtree rooted at 3): Visit node 3 (no left or right children, so we return to 5).
			Visit node 5.
			Traverse the right subtree (subtree rooted at 7): Visit node 7 (no left or right children, so we return to 5).
		Visit node 10.
		Traverse the right subtree (subtree rooted at 13):
			Traverse the left subtree (subtree rooted at 11): Visit node 11 (no left or right children, so we return to 13).
			Visit node 13.
			Traverse the right subtree (subtree rooted at 14): Visit node 14 (no left or right children, so we return to 13).
2. Visit the root node (15).

3. Traverse the right subtree (subtree rooted at 20):
	Traverse the left subtree (subtree rooted at 17):
		Traverse the left subtree (subtree rooted at 16): Visit node 16 (no left or right children, so we return to 17).
		Visit node 17.
		Traverse the right subtree (subtree rooted at 19): Visit node 19 (no left or right children, so we return to 17).
	Visit node 20.
	Traverse the right subtree (subtree rooted at 25):
		Traverse the left subtree (subtree rooted at 22): Visit node 22 (no left or right children, so we return to 25).
		Visit node 25.
		Traverse the right subtree (subtree rooted at 27): Visit node 27 (no left or right children, so we return to 25).



In-Order Traversal Sequence:
The in-order traversal of this tree would produce the sequence: 3, 5, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20, 22, 25, 27.



Implementation in Python:
Here's how you could implement this in Python:

class Node:
    def __init__(self, key):
        self.left = None
        self.right = None
        self.val = key

def in_order_traversal(root):
    if root:
        # Traverse the left subtree
        in_order_traversal(root.left)
        # Visit the root
        print(root.val, end=' ')
        # Traverse the right subtree
        in_order_traversal(root.right)

# Create the tree
root = Node(15)
root.left = Node(10)
root.right = Node(20)
root.left.left = Node(5)
root.left.right = Node(13)
root.right.left = Node(17)
root.right.right = Node(25)
root.left.left.left = Node(3)
root.left.left.right = Node(7)
root.left.right.left = Node(11)
root.left.right.right = Node(14)
root.right.left.left = Node(16)
root.right.left.right = Node(19)
root.right.right.left = Node(22)
root.right.right.right = Node(27)

# Perform in-order traversal
in_order_traversal(root)


This code will output the in-order traversal sequence: 3 5 7 10 11 13 14 15 16 17 19 20 22 25 27.
