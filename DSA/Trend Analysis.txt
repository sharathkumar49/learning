Trend Analysis: 

Trend analysis is the practice of collecting data over a period of time to identify patterns, trends, or general directions in a particular field. This technique is commonly used in various fields, such as finance, marketing, economics, and more, to make informed decisions and predictions.


Hereâ€™s how it works:

Data Collection: Gather relevant data over a specific period. This could be stock prices, sales figures, website traffic, etc.

Data Analysis: Use statistical methods and tools to analyze the collected data. This might involve plotting data points on graphs to visualize trends.

Trend Identification: Identify consistent patterns or trends in the data. This could be upward trends, downward trends, seasonal patterns, or cyclical trends.

Prediction: Use the identified trends to make predictions about future behavior. This helps in decision-making, strategic planning, and risk management.

For example, businesses use trend analysis to forecast sales, identify market opportunities, and stay ahead of competitors.
