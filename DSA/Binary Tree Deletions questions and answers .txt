Some serious by me regarding Binary Tree Deletions: 


explain me the below delete method clearly:

class BinarySearchTreeNode:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

    def add_child(self, data):
        if data == self.data:
            return # node already exist

        if data < self.data:
            if self.left:
                self.left.add_child(data)
            else:
                self.left = BinarySearchTreeNode(data)
        else:
            if self.right:
                self.right.add_child(data)
            else:
                self.right = BinarySearchTreeNode(data)


    def search(self, val):
        if self.data == val:
            return True

        if val < self.data:
            if self.left:
                return self.left.search(val)
            else:
                return False

        if val > self.data:
            if self.right:
                return self.right.search(val)
            else:
                return False

    def in_order_traversal(self):
        elements = []
        if self.left:
            elements += self.left.in_order_traversal()

        elements.append(self.data)

        if self.right:
            elements += self.right.in_order_traversal()

        return elements

    def delete(self, val):
        if val < self.data:
            if self.left:
                self.left = self.left.delete(val)
        elif val > self.data:
            if self.right:
                self.right = self.right.delete(val)
        else:
            if self.left is None and self.right is None:
                return None
            elif self.left is None:
                return self.right
            elif self.right is None:
                return self.left

            min_val = self.right.find_min()
            self.data = min_val
            self.right = self.right.delete(min_val)

        return self

    def find_max(self):
        if self.right is None:
            return self.data
        return self.right.find_max()

    def find_min(self):
        if self.left is None:
            return self.data
        return self.left.find_min()


def build_tree(elements):
    print("Building tree with these elements:",elements)
    root = BinarySearchTreeNode(elements[0])

    for i in range(1,len(elements)):
        root.add_child(elements[i])

    return root

if __name__ == '__main__':
    numbers_tree = build_tree([17, 4, 1, 20, 9, 23, 18, 34])
    numbers_tree.delete(20)
    print("After deleting 20 ",numbers_tree.in_order_traversal()) # this should print [1, 4, 9, 17, 18, 23, 34]

    numbers_tree = build_tree([17, 4, 1, 20, 9, 23, 18, 34])
    numbers_tree.delete(9)
    print("After deleting 9 ",numbers_tree.in_order_traversal())  # this should print [1, 4, 17, 18, 20, 23, 34]

    numbers_tree = build_tree([17, 4, 1, 20, 9, 23, 18, 34])
    numbers_tree.delete(17)
    print("After deleting 17 ",numbers_tree.in_order_traversal())  # this should print [1, 4, 9, 18, 20, 23, 34]
	
	
	
	
Certainly! Let's break down the delete method in the BinarySearchTreeNode class. The goal of this method is to delete a node with the specified value val from the binary search tree.

Here are the key steps and logic involved in the delete method:

1. Search for the node to be deleted:
	If 'val' is less than the current node's data (self.data), recursively call the delete method on the left child.
	If 'val' is greater than the current node's data (self.data), recursively call the delete method on the right child.

2. Node found:
	If val is equal to the current node's data (self.data), this is the node we want to delete.

3. Node with no children (leaf node):
	If the node to be deleted has no children (both self.left and self.right are None), return None.

4. Node with one child:
If the node to be deleted has only one child:
	If the node has no left child (self.left is None), return the right child (self.right).
	If the node has no right child (self.right is None), return the left child (self.left).

5. Node with two children:
If the node to be deleted has two children:
	Find the minimum value in the right subtree (min_val = self.right.find_min()). This value will replace the current node's data.
	Set the current node's data to min_val.
	Recursively call the delete method on the right child to delete the node with the minimum value (self.right = self.right.delete(min_val)).

6. Return the updated node:
	After the deletion, return the current node (return self).


Here's a detailed walk-through of the delete method's code:

def delete(self, val):
    # Step 1: Search for the node to be deleted
    if val < self.data:
        if self.left:
            self.left = self.left.delete(val)
    elif val > self.data:
        if self.right:
            self.right = self.right.delete(val)
    else:
        # Step 2: Node found

        # Step 3: Node with no children (leaf node)
        if self.left is None and self.right is None:
            return None
        
        # Step 4: Node with one child
        elif self.left is None:
            return self.right
        elif self.right is None:
            return self.left

        # Step 5: Node with two children
        min_val = self.right.find_min()
        self.data = min_val
        self.right = self.right.delete(min_val)

    # Step 6: Return the updated node
    return self


By following this method, you can effectively delete a node from the binary search tree while maintaining the tree's structure and properties. Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Sorry, I don't understand each and every line. Explain like why each and every line is for.



No problem! Let's go through the delete method line by line, and I'll explain what each part does.

def delete(self, val):

This line defines the delete method, which takes val as a parameter. self refers to the current instance of the BinarySearchTreeNode class.




    if val < self.data:
        if self.left:
            self.left = self.left.delete(val)

If the value to be deleted (val) is less than the current node's data (self.data), we need to search in the left subtree. If the left child exists (self.left), we recursively call the delete method on the left child.




    elif val > self.data:
        if self.right:
            self.right = self.right.delete(val)

If the value to be deleted (val) is greater than the current node's data (self.data), we need to search in the right subtree. If the right child exists (self.right), we recursively call the delete method on the right child.
No problem! Let's go through the delete method line by line, and I'll explain what each part does.




    else:
This else block is executed if the value to be deleted (val) is equal to the current node's data (self.data). This means we have found the node that needs to be deleted.



        if self.left is None and self.right is None:
            return None
If the node to be deleted has no children (both self.left and self.right are None), it is a leaf node. We return None to remove this node.




        elif self.left is None:
            return self.right

If the node to be deleted has no left child (self.left is None), we return the right child (self.right). This effectively removes the current node and connects its parent to the right child.




        elif self.right is None:
            return self.left

If the node to be deleted has no right child (self.right is None), we return the left child (self.left). This effectively removes the current node and connects its parent to the left child.




        min_val = self.right.find_min()
        self.data = min_val
        self.right = self.right.delete(min_val)


If the node to be deleted has two children:
1. We find the minimum value (min_val) in the right subtree using the find_min method.
2. We set the current node's data (self.data) to min_val.
3. We recursively call the delete method on the right child to delete the node with the minimum value. This ensures that the minimum value is removed from its original position.




    return self

Finally, we return the current node (self). This ensures that the tree structure is maintained and updated correctly after the deletion.

I hope this detailed breakdown helps you understand the delete method better! Let me know if you have any more questions or if there's anything else you'd like to know.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	if self.left is None and self.right is None: 
		return None 
		
At this point, why we are returning None. we have to make the self.data = None, right? correct me if I am wrong





That's a good question! Let's dive into why we return None rather than setting self.data to None.

When a node is a leaf node (i.e., it has no left or right children), and we want to delete it, we return None to remove the reference to this node entirely from the tree structure. If we only set self.data to None, it would leave a None value in the tree, which would disrupt the binary search tree property.

Here's a simple example to illustrate this:


Imagine you have a tree like this:

    5
   / \
  3   7
 / \
1   4





If you want to delete the node with value 1, you only need to remove the reference to this node from its parent (3). By returning None, you effectively tell the parent node (3) that it no longer has a left child.

If you were to set self.data to None instead of returning None, the tree would look like this:


    5
   / \
  3   7
 / \
None  4



This is problematic because the binary search tree relies on having valid integer values to maintain its structure. The tree would not function correctly with a None value as a data element.

So, returning None in the delete method ensures that the tree remains a valid binary search tree after the deletion. The parent node of the deleted node will no longer have a reference to it, effectively removing the node from the tree.

I hope this clarifies why we return None for leaf nodes! Let me know if you have any more questions.



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


How would returning None behaves?


When we return None, we essentially remove the reference to the node from its parent, effectively deleting the node from the tree. Here's how it works in practice:

Consider the following binary search tree:

    10
   /  \
  5    15
 / \
3   7



Let's say we want to delete the node with value 3. Here's what happens step-by-step:
1. We start at the root node (10) and look for the node with value 3.
2. Since 3 is less than 10, we move to the left child (5).
3. Since 3 is less than 5, we move to the left child (3).
4. We find the node with value 3. Since it is a leaf node (it has no children), we return None.

Here's how the code handles this:

if val < self.data:
    if self.left:
        self.left = self.left.delete(val)



When self.left.delete(3) is called on the node with value 5, it returns None because the node with value 3 is a leaf node. As a result, the left child of the node with value 5 is set to None.

After deletion, the tree looks like this:


    10
   /  \
  5    15
   \
    7



The node with value 3 has been removed from the tree.

To summarize, returning None effectively removes the node from the tree by updating the parent node's reference to that node. This ensures that the tree remains a valid binary search tree after the deletion. If we only set self.data to None, the node would still exist in the tree with a None value, which would disrupt the tree's structure and properties.

I hope this clarifies how returning None behaves! Let me know if you have any more questions or need further explanation.



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I still don't understand, how the None value breaks relation between 5 and 3.


Alright, let's break it down further with a concrete example.

Consider this part of the tree where we have the nodes 5 and 3:

  5
 /
3



Let's say you want to delete the node with the value 3. Here's what happens in the delete method:
1. You start at the node 5 and call the delete method with the value 3.
2. Since 3 is less than 5, you call the delete method recursively on the left child of 5, which is the node 3.

Now, you're at the node 3:

def delete(self, val):
    if val < self.data:
        if self.left:
            self.left = self.left.delete(val)
    elif val > self.data:
        if self.right:
            self.right = self.right.delete(val)
    else:
        if self.left is None and self.right is None:
            return None
        elif self.left is None:
            return self.right
        elif self.right is None:
            return self.left

        min_val = self.right.find_min()
        self.data = min_val
        self.right = self.right.delete(min_val)

    return self




Since 3 matches self.data in this context (i.e., self is the node 3), the else block is executed.

if self.left is None and self.right is None:
    return None
	
	
	
The node 3 has no children (self.left is None and self.right is None), so we return None.
The return value None is assigned to the left child of node 5:

self.left = self.left.delete(val)


After returning None, the left child of node 5 is set to None, effectively removing the node 3 from the tree. The parent node 5 no longer has a reference to node 3.

Here's the updated tree after deletion:

  5


The relationship between 5 and 3 is broken because the left child of 5 is now set to None.

In summary, returning None from the delete method tells the parent node to remove the reference to the deleted node. This way, the node is effectively removed from the tree, maintaining the tree's structure and properties.

I hope this makes it clearer! Let me know if you have any more questions or need further explanation.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Where it is being mentioned the value of node 5 is set to None


To clarify, the value of node 5 itself is not being set to None. Instead, the reference to the node with value 3 (the left child of node 5) is being set to None. This effectively removes the node with value 3 from the tree.

Here's how it works step-by-step:

1. When the node with value 3 is found and needs to be deleted, we return None because it is a leaf node.

if self.left is None and self.right is None:
    return None



2. This None value is then assigned to the left child of node 5, effectively removing the node with value 3.

self.left = self.left.delete(val)




In this code snippet, self.left.delete(val) returns None, which means self.left becomes None.

After deletion, the tree looks like this:

  5


The relationship between node 5 and node 3 is broken because self.left is now set to None.

In summary, returning None removes the reference to the node with value 3, and it is this assignment (self.left = self.left.delete(val)) that sets the left child of node 5 to None, effectively deleting the node with value 3.

I hope this clears up the confusion! Let me know if you have any more questions or need further explanation.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


That self.left is the node 10's left right, not the node 5's left



I see where the confusion might be coming from. Let me explain further.

In the context of the code provided, self.left or self.right always refer to the left or right child of the current node (self). The variable self changes depending on which node's method is being executed.

Let's revisit the example:


# Initial tree structure
    10
   /  \
  5    15
 / \
3   7



Let's say you call delete(3) on the root node (10):

1. At the root node (10):


if val < self.data:
    if self.left:
        self.left = self.left.delete(val)

Since 3 is less than 10, the code recursively calls delete(3) on the left child (5).




2. Now at the node with value 5:

if val < self.data:
    if self.left:
        self.left = self.left.delete(val)

Since 3 is less than 5, the code recursively calls delete(3) on the left child (3).



3. Now at the node with value 3:

if val < self.data:
    if self.left:
        self.left = self.left.delete(val)
elif val > self.data:
    if self.right:
        self.right = self.right.delete(val)
else:
    if self.left is None and self.right is None:
        return None
    elif self.left is None:
        return self.right
    elif self.right is None:
        return self.left
    min_val = self.right.find_min()
    self.data = min_val
    self.right = self.right.delete(min_val)


Since 3 is equal to self.data (current node's data), the else block executes. Because this node has no children (self.left is None and self.right is None), it returns None.


This None return value propagates back to the previous recursive call at node 5:

self.left = self.left.delete(val)



Here, self.left (the left child of node 5) is assigned the return value, which is None. As a result, the left child of node 5 is now None, effectively deleting the node 3.

Updated tree after deletion:

    10
   /  \
  5    15
   \
    7


I hope this clarifies how the reference to the node is updated to None to break the relationship and remove the node from the tree. Let me know if you need more help!
