For all exercises use Queue class implemented in main tutorial.

1. Design a food ordering system where your python program will run two threads,

	i. Place Order: This thread will be placing an order and inserting that into a queue. This thread places new order every 0.5 second. (hint: use time.sleep(0.5) function)

	ii. Serve Order: This thread will server the order. All you need to do is pop the order out of the queue and print it. This thread serves an order every 2 seconds. Also start this thread 1 second after place order thread is started.


Pass following list as an argument to place order thread,

	orders = ['pizza','samosa','pasta','biryani','burger']

This problem is a producer,consumer problem where place_order thread is producing orders whereas server_order thread is consuming the food orders. Use Queue class implemented in a video tutorial.



Solution: 
---------

import threading
import time

from collections import deque

class Queue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.buffer = deque()

    def enqueue(self, val):
        self.buffer.appendleft(val)

    def dequeue(self):
        if len(self.buffer)==0:
            print("Queue is empty")
            return

        return self.buffer.pop()

    def is_empty(self):
        return len(self.buffer) == 0

    def size(self):
        return len(self.buffer)

food_order_queue = Queue()

def place_orders(orders):
    for order in orders:
        print("Placing order for:",order)
        food_order_queue.enqueue(order)
        time.sleep(0.5)


def serve_orders():
    time.sleep(1)
    while True:
        order = food_order_queue.dequeue()
        print("Now serving: ",order)
        time.sleep(2)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    orders = ['pizza','samosa','pasta','biryani','burger']
    t1 = threading.Thread(target=place_orders, args=(orders,))
    t2 = threading.Thread(target=serve_orders)

    t1.start()
    t2.start()

2. Write a program to print binary numbers from 1 to 10 using Queue. Use Queue class implemented in main tutorial. Binary sequence should look like,
    1
    10
    11
    100
    101
    110
    111
    1000
    1001
    1010
Hint: Notice a pattern above. After 1 second and third number is 1+0 and 1+1. 4th and 5th number are second number (i.e. 10) + 0 and second number (i.e. 10) + 1.

You also need to add front() function in queue class that can return the front element in the queue.



from collections import deque

class Queue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.buffer = deque()

    def enqueue(self, val):
        self.buffer.appendleft(val)

    def dequeue(self):
        if len(self.buffer)==0:
            print("Queue is empty")
            return

        return self.buffer.pop()

    def is_empty(self):
        return len(self.buffer) == 0

    def size(self):
        return len(self.buffer)

    def front(self):
        return self.buffer[-1]

def produce_binary_numbers(n):
    numbers_queue = Queue()
    numbers_queue.enqueue("1")

    for i in range(n):
        front = numbers_queue.front()
        print("   ", front)
        numbers_queue.enqueue(front + "0")
        numbers_queue.enqueue(front + "1")

        numbers_queue.dequeue()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    produce_binary_numbers(10)
