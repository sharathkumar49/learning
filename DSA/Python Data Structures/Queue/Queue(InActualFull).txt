Queue Data Structure: A Comprehensive Guide:

Introduction to Queues:
A queue is a fundamental data structure that follows the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle. This means that the first element added to the queue will be the first element removed.

Real-World Analogy:
Queues are used in daily life, such as:
 - Movie ticket lines: The first person in line gets served first.
 - Stock price updates: Financial data flows continuously from stock exchanges to platforms like Yahoo Finance or MoneyControl.



Stock Price Data Flow Example:
Stock prices from exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) are continuously pushed to financial portals like Yahoo Finance in real-time.

For example:
At 11:01 AM, Walmart’s stock price is $131.10
At 11:02 AM, the stock price updates to $132.12

Traditional Approach: Using HTTP Requests:
One way to transmit this data is by using an HTTP server at Yahoo Finance that accepts HTTP POST requests from the NYSE.

Example JSON data sent via HTTP POST:
json
{
  "company": "WMT",
  "timestamp": "15 Apr, 11:01 AM",
  "price": 131.10
}
json
{
  "company": "WMT",
  "timestamp": "15 Apr, 11:02 AM",
  "price": 132.12
}

However, this approach has major drawbacks:
Loss of Data – If the HTTP server at Yahoo Finance is down, stock price data is lost permanently since it relies on synchronous calls.
Tightly Coupled Architecture – If a new consumer (e.g., Google Finance) wants to access these stock prices, NYSE engineers must modify their code. This makes the system inflexible and harder to scale.



Using Queues to Solve These Issues:
To avoid these problems, a queue-based architecture can be used where NYSE pushes stock prices into a memory buffer. Consumers like Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, and MoneyControl can retrieve the prices in FIFO order without tightly coupling the producer (NYSE) to each consumer.

Producer-Consumer Problem:
This is a classic Producer-Consumer model, where:
The producer (NYSE) generates stock price updates.
Consumers (Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, etc.) retrieve stock prices in FIFO order.
This allows loose coupling, so new consumers can easily access stock prices without modifications to NYSE's system.





Queue Implementation in Different Programming Languages
Python (Using List)

wmt_stock_price_queue = []
wmt_stock_price_queue.insert(0, 131.10)
wmt_stock_price_queue.insert(0, 132.12)
wmt_stock_price_queue.insert(0, 135)

print(wmt_stock_price_queue.pop())  # Output: 131.10
print(wmt_stock_price_queue.pop())  # Output: 132.12
print(wmt_stock_price_queue.pop())  # Output: 135

Issue with Lists:
Python lists aren’t efficient for queues because inserting at index 0 causes reallocation of memory and shifting of elements, making the process slow.



Python (Using collections.deque):

from collections import deque

q = deque()
q.appendleft(5)
q.appendleft(8)
q.appendleft(10)

print(q.pop())  # Output: 5
print(q.pop())  # Output: 8
print(q.pop())  # Output: 10

Advantages of deque:
Efficient memory usage
Constant-time insertions/removals (O(1) complexity)



Python (Queue Class Implementation Using deque):

from collections import deque

class Queue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.buffer = deque()

    def enqueue(self, val):
        self.buffer.appendleft(val)

    def dequeue(self):
        return self.buffer.pop()

    def is_empty(self):
        return len(self.buffer) == 0

    def size(self):
        return len(self.buffer)

pq = Queue()
pq.enqueue({"company": "WMT", "timestamp": "15 Apr, 11:01 AM", "price": 131.10})
pq.enqueue({"company": "WMT", "timestamp": "15 Apr, 11:02 AM", "price": 132.12})
pq.enqueue({"company": "WMT", "timestamp": "15 Apr, 11:03 AM", "price": 135})

print(pq.size())  # Output: 3
print(pq.dequeue())  # First stock price is removed




Java (Using LinkedList):

import java.util.Queue;
import java.util.LinkedList;

Queue<Integer> q = new LinkedList<>();
q.add(5);
q.add(89);
System.out.println(q.remove()); // Output: 5
Java implements queues using LinkedList, ensuring efficient removal and addition operations.




C++ (Using std::queue):

#include <queue>
#include <iostream>

std::queue<int> q; 
q.push(5);
q.push(89);

std::cout << q.pop(); // Output: 5



Big-O Complexity Analysis:
Operation	        Average Time Complexity	  Worst-case Complexity
Access/Search	    O(n)	                  O(n)
Insertion/Deletion	O(1)	                  O(1)



Conclusion:
Queues ensure loose coupling between producers and consumers, making them ideal for real-time data streaming (e.g., stock price updates).
They follow FIFO order, ensuring fair and sequential processing.
Python’s collections.deque is preferred over lists for implementing queues due to memory efficiency.
Different programming languages provide native queue support via LinkedLists (Java) and std::queue (C++).
