Introduction:
Infix notation (A + B) follows traditional arithmetic rules, requiring operator precedence and parentheses. Postfix notation (AB+), also known as Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), eliminates the need for precedence handling, making evaluation simpler.

To convert an infix expression to postfix, we use a stack to manage operators, ensuring correct precedence and associativity.

Step-by-Step Code Explanation:
1. Implementing the Stack Class

from collections import deque

class Stack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.container = deque()

    def push(self, val):
        self.container.append(val)

    def pop(self):
        return self.container.pop()

    def peek(self):
        return self.container[-1] if self.container else None

    def is_empty(self):
        return len(self.container) == 0


What this does:
Implements a stack using deque (efficient for adding/removing elements).
Provides helper methods: push(), pop(), peek(), is_empty().
Stack stores operators temporarily while processing the infix expression.




2. Defining Operator Precedence and Associativity
python
# Define precedence and associativity for operators
PRECEDENCE = {'+': 1, '-': 1, '*': 2, '/': 2, '^': 3}
ASSOCIATIVITY = {'+': 'L', '-': 'L', '*': 'L', '/': 'L', '^': 'R'}

def is_higher_precedence(op1, op2):
    """Returns True if op1 has higher precedence than op2."""
    return PRECEDENCE[op1] > PRECEDENCE[op2]

def is_same_precedence_left_associative(op1, op2):
    """Checks if both operators have same precedence and left associativity."""
    return PRECEDENCE[op1] == PRECEDENCE[op2] and ASSOCIATIVITY[op1] == 'L'
	
Why we need this:
Higher precedence operators (like * vs. +) should be processed first.
Left associativity (L) ensures evaluation order (A - B - C â†’ ((A - B) - C)).
Right associativity (R) applies only to exponentiation (A ^ B ^ C â†’ A ^ (B ^ C)).





3.Implementing infix_to_postfix()

def infix_to_postfix(expression):
    stack = Stack()  # Stack to hold operators
    output = []  # Output list for postfix expression

Initialize an empty stack and output list.




4.Handling Different Cases:
Case 1 â€“ Operands (A, B, C, etc.)

    for char in expression:
        if char.isalnum():  # If operand, append to output
            output.append(char)
			
Operands are added directly to the output (they donâ€™t require precedence handling).


Case 2 â€“ Operators (+, -, , /, ^)

        elif char in PRECEDENCE:  # If operator, process stack precedence
            while (not stack.is_empty() and stack.peek() != '(' and
                   (is_higher_precedence(stack.peek(), char) or is_same_precedence_left_associative(stack.peek(), char))):
                output.append(stack.pop())
            stack.push(char)
			
Before pushing an operator onto the stack, we:
 - Pop operators of higher precedence.
 - If same precedence and left associative, pop first.
 - Push the new operator onto the stack.



Case 3 â€“ Parentheses:

        elif char == '(':
            stack.push(char)

        elif char == ')':  # Pop until '(' is found
            while not stack.is_empty() and stack.peek() != '(':
                output.append(stack.pop())
            stack.pop()  # Remove '('
			
Left Parenthesis (() â†’ Simply push onto stack.
Right Parenthesis ()) â†’ Pop everything until ( is found.






5. Emptying the Stack at End

    while not stack.is_empty():
        output.append(stack.pop())

    return ''.join(output)

Any remaining operators must be popped at the end.

Ok. I don't get it when '^' comes. what happens when '^' comes



Great question, Sharath! The ^ operator (exponentiation) behaves differently from other operators because it has right associativity instead of left associativity.

How ^ Works in Infix-to-Postfix Conversion
Higher Precedence (^ has precedence 3, higher than *, /, +, -).

Right Associativity (R) â†’ Unlike +, -, *, / (which process left to right), ^ is right associative and processes from right to left.

What Happens When ^ Appears?

Case 1: Right Associativity Avoids Premature Popping
precedence[stack.peek()] == precedence[char] and associativity[char] == 'L'

In our operator precedence check, ^ avoids popping same-precedence operators if another ^ appears in the stack because it's right associative.

Example: A^B^C:
Expected postfix expression: A B C ^ ^

Execution Steps:
Step	Symbol	Stack	Output
1	      A	      -	      A
2	      ^	      ^	      A
3	      B	      ^	      AB
4	      ^	      ^ ^	  AB
5	      C	      ^ ^	  ABC
6	     End	   -	  ABC^^


Here, we push the second ^ onto the stack before popping the first one to ensure right-to-left evaluation (A ^ (B ^ C)) instead of (A ^ B) ^ C.

Case 2: Mixed with Other Operators
Example:
A * B ^ C
Expected postfix expression: A B C ^ *

Execution:
* has lower precedence than ^, so ^ gets processed first.
Final order ensures exponentiation happens before multiplication.



Summary:
âœ… ^ has right associativity, so it does not pop same-precedence operators. 
âœ… Ensures correct exponentiation order (A ^ (B ^ C) instead of (A ^ B) ^ C). 
âœ… Higher precedence than *, /, +, -, so it gets processed earlier.



---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So we simply add it to the stack? no comparisons made

Not quite, Sharath! When ^ (exponentiation) appears, we do make a comparisonâ€”but it behaves differently from left-associative operators.

How ^ is Handled:
1.If the stack is empty or has a lower precedence operator, we push ^ onto the stack.
2.If another ^ is already on top of the stack, we do NOT pop it immediately.
Since ^ is right-associative, we allow multiple ^ operators to stack up rather than pop them prematurely.

Comparison Happens, but Differently
For left-associative operators like +, -, *, /, we pop same-precedence operators before pushing a new one. For ^, we keep it in the stack instead of popping an earlier ^.

Example: A ^ B ^ C
A â†’ Goes directly to output.
^ â†’ Pushed onto stack.
B â†’ Goes directly to output.
^ â†’ Pushed onto stack without popping the previous ^ (right-associative rule).
C â†’ Goes directly to output.

End of Expression â†’ Pop both ^, ensuring correct order: A B C ^ ^.

Why This Matters
âœ… Keeps correct order for exponentiation â†’ A ^ (B ^ C), NOT (A ^ B) ^ C. âœ… Ensures right-to-left evaluation of power operations.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I don't understand anything. Explain with this example. A+B*(C^D-E)


Got it, Sharath! Let's break it down step by step with your example A + B * (C ^ D - E) to show exactly how ^ is handled and how the entire expression converts to postfix notation.

ðŸ“Œ Given Infix Expression:
A + B * (C ^ D - E)


We process it using operator precedence:

Operator	Precedence	Associativity
+, -	      1	           Left
*, /	      2	           Left
^	          3	           Right


Key Observations:
Parentheses ( ) define a subexpression.
^ has the highest precedence and is right associative.
* and + follow left associativity.



Step-by-Step Processing:
Initialization:
stack (stores operators).
output (collects postfix notation).


Iterating Through Characters:
Step 1: Encounter A (Operand)
âœ… Added directly to output â†’ output = [A] âœ… Stack remains empty â†’ stack = []

Step 2: Encounter + (Operator)
âœ… Stack is empty, so push + â†’ stack = [+]

Step 3: Encounter B (Operand)
âœ… Added directly to output â†’ output = [A, B]

Step 4: Encounter * (Operator)
âœ… * has higher precedence than + â†’ Push * âœ… Stack now contains: stack = [+, *]

Step 5: Encounter ( (Left Parenthesis)
âœ… Always push ( onto stack â†’ stack = [+, *, (]

Step 6: Encounter C (Operand)
âœ… Added directly to output â†’ output = [A, B, C]

Step 7: Encounter ^ (Exponentiation Operator)
âœ… ^ is pushed onto stack because:
It's the first operator inside parentheses.
It's right associative, so no immediate popping. âœ… stack = [+, *, (, ^]

Step 8: Encounter D (Operand)
âœ… Added directly to output â†’ output = [A, B, C, D]

Step 9: Encounter - (Operator)
âœ… - has lower precedence than ^, so:
Pop ^ first, then push -. âœ… stack = [+, *, (, -] âœ… output = [A, B, C, D, ^]

Step 10: Encounter E (Operand)
âœ… Added directly to output â†’ output = [A, B, C, D, ^, E]

Step 11: Encounter ) (Right Parenthesis)
âœ… Pop everything inside until ( is found âœ… stack = [+, *] âœ… output = [A, B, C, D, ^, E, -]

Step 12: End of Expression â†’ Pop Remaining Operators
âœ… Pop * then + âœ… stack = [] âœ… output = [A, B, C, D, ^, E, -, *, +]



Final Postfix Expression:
ABCD^E-*+




Recap: How ^ Was Handled:
^ was pushed into the stack normally.
When - was encountered, we popped ^ first because it had higher precedence.
We did not pop ^ immediately when another operator of the same precedence appeared (right-associative behavior).



Key Takeaways:
âœ… ^ stays in the stack until an operator of lower precedence forces it to be popped. 
âœ… Right associativity prevents premature popping when consecutive ^ appear. 
âœ… Final postfix notation keeps correct precedence ordering.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Give me an example then which has same precedence as '^'


The only operator in our defined precedence table that has the same precedence as ^ is another ^ itself!

Since ^ is right associative, it behaves uniquely when multiple exponentiation operators appear in a sequence.

Example: A ^ B ^ C
Infix Expression: A ^ B ^ C
Expected Postfix Expression: A B C ^ ^

Processing Order:
Right Associative Rule ensures it evaluates as A ^ (B ^ C), NOT (A ^ B) ^ C.

Step-by-Step Breakdown
Step	Symbol	Stack	      Output
1	      A	      -	            A
2	      ^	      ^	            A
3	      B	      ^	            AB
4	      ^	      ^ ^	        AB
5	      C	      ^ ^	        ABC
6	     End	  -	            ABC^^

This ensures the correct exponentiation order, following right-to-left evaluation.
