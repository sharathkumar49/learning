Post-order traversal is another depth-first search (DFS) method, where the nodes are visited in the following order:

Left Subtree: Visit all the nodes in the left subtree.
Right Subtree: Visit all the nodes in the right subtree.
Root: Visit the root node.



Example of a Post-Order Traversal
Consider this binary tree:

           8
       /      \
     4        12
    / \      /  \
  2   6    10   14
 / \ / \   / \ / \
1  3 5 7  9 11 13 15


1, 3, 2, 5, 7, 6, 4, 9, 11, 10, 13, 15, 14, 12, 8

Post-Order Traversal Step-by-Step:
1. Start at node 8:
	Traverse the left subtree (subtree rooted at 4):
		Traverse the left subtree (subtree rooted at 2):
			Traverse the left subtree (subtree rooted at 1): Visit node 1 (no left or right children, so we return to 2).
			Traverse the right subtree (subtree rooted at 3): Visit node 3 (no left or right children, so we return to 2).
			Visit node 2.
	Traverse the right subtree (subtree rooted at 6):
		Traverse the left subtree (subtree rooted at 5): Visit node 5 (no left or right children, so we return to 6).
		Traverse the right subtree (subtree rooted at 7): Visit node 7 (no left or right children, so we return to 6).
		Visit node 6.
	Visit node 4.
2. Traverse the right subtree (subtree rooted at 12):
	Traverse the left subtree (subtree rooted at 10):
		Traverse the left subtree (subtree rooted at 9): Visit node 9 (no left or right children, so we return to 10).
		Traverse the right subtree (subtree rooted at 11): Visit node 11 (no left or right children, so we return to 10).
		Visit node 10.
	Traverse the right subtree (subtree rooted at 14):
		Traverse the left subtree (subtree rooted at 13): Visit node 13 (no left or right children, so we return to 14).
		Traverse the right subtree (subtree rooted at 15): Visit node 15 (no left or right children, so we return to 14).
		Visit node 14.
	Visit node 12.
3. Visit the root node (8).



Post-Order Traversal Sequence:
The post-order traversal of this tree would produce the sequence: 1, 3, 2, 5, 7, 6, 4, 9, 11, 10, 13, 15, 14, 12, 8.
                                                           
Implementation
In pseudocode, the post-order traversal can be implemented as:

def post_order_traversal(node):
    if node is not None:
        post_order_traversal(node.left)
        post_order_traversal(node.right)
        print(node.value)


This method ensures that you visit the left subtree first, then the right subtree, and finally the root node.
