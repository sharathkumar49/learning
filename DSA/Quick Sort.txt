Quick Sort is a highly efficient sorting algorithm and is based on the principle of Divide and Conquer. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively.


Detailed Steps
1. Choose a Pivot: Select a pivot element from the array. Common strategies include choosing the first element, the last element, the middle element, or a random element.

2. Partitioning: Reorder the array so that all elements with values less than the pivot come before it, and all elements with values greater than the pivot come after it. After the partitioning, the pivot is in its final position.  (Partitioning is technically putting a pivot in a right place)

3. Recursive Sorting: Recursively apply the above steps to the sub-arrays of elements with smaller values and the sub-arrays of elements with greater values.


There are two types of partitions schemes:
